echo "--------------------------------"
echo "# Easy mode - walks through each person's predictions"
echo "node updateWeights.js --interactive"
echo ""
echo "# Preview mode - see what would happen without saving"
echo "node updateWeights.js --dry-run --interactive"

echo "Base rules (always apply):"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Become superhero: weight -= 1"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Don't become superhero (no guess): weight += 1"
echo ""
echo "Prediction bonuses/penalties (in addition to base rules):"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Correct guess: bonus reduction (bigger for unlikely winners)"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Wrong guess: penalty increase (minimum +1.2, always worse than no guess)"

echo "Example 1: Manual single person updates"
echo "---------------------------------------"
echo "# Johan guessed Sam would win, but Ali actually won"

echo "# Kemila made no guess, Dom won"

echo "Example 2: Dry run - preview changes without saving"
echo "---------------------------------------------------"
echo "# Preview what would happen if Johan guessed Sam but Ali won"
echo "node updateWeights.js --dry-run Johan Ali Sam"
echo ""
echo "# Preview batch update without making changes"
echo "node updateWeights.js --dry-run --batch '[{\"person\":\"Johan\",\"guess\":\"Sam\"}]' Ali"

echo "üí° Strategic insights:"
echo "- Not guessing is safe: +1 if you don't win, -1 if you do"
echo "- Wrong guesses are always worse than not guessing (minimum +2.2 total penalty)"
echo "- Guessing favorites incorrectly = big penalties (base 1.2 + up to 3.0 more)"
echo "- Guessing longshots incorrectly = smaller penalties (closer to base 1.2)"
echo "- Correct guesses on underdogs give big rewards (inverse probability scaling)"
echo "- Even winners get penalized for wrong guesses"
echo "- The system encourages thoughtful predictions, not just safe bets"

echo "üéØ Recommended workflow:"
echo "1. Everyone makes predictions before spinning the wheel"
echo "2. Spin the wheel on wheelofnames.com"
echo "3. Run interactive mode: node updateWeights.js --interactive"
echo "   (It will ask about each person's guess and the winner)"
echo "4. Optional: Use --dry-run first to preview changes"
echo "5. Generate new wheelOfDeathList.txt: node superHero.js"
